# Critical and Fumble Decks
This is a modernized and optimized version of bnason's [Pathfinder Fumble & Critical Deck](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?16642-MOD-Pathfinder-Fumble-amp-Critical-Deck) extension. Currently, it removes the "REROLL" table entries to take advantage of Fantasy Grounds that have improved since initial release. It also adds tables of critial types and fumble types so that you only need to have 2 tables pinned to hotkeys for quick use rather that 8.

# Compatibility
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.1.13 (2022-01-05).
