# Critical and Fumble Decks
This module is a modernized and optimized version of bnason's [Pathfinder Fumble & Critical Deck](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?16642-MOD-Pathfinder-Fumble-amp-Critical-Deck) module. It removes the "REROLL" table entries to take advantage of Fantasy Grounds behaviors that have improved since the initial release. It also adds tables linked to the various critical and fumble types to simplify manual use.

# Compatibility
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.2.2 (2022-06-07).
